# Kent Writes

If you are reading this... You're really fast. I'll be updating this soon!

[Follow `@kent_writes` on twitter](https://twitter.com/kent_writes). It's the
twitter account where I tweet about my experience as a writer as well as nice
quotes that I enjoy like this one:

> “There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.” ― Maya
> Angelou

## Shurlan

> An insecure 14-year-old surgeon struggles to learn magic that only works if
> she's confident in her abilities.

Planning on adding things to describe the book. Will update soon. In the
meantime, here are a few links:

- [The Shurlan Manuscript](https://kcd.im/shurlan) (work in progress)
- [My Writer Newsletter](https://kcd.im/shurlan-news) (not the same as the
  newsletter you can sign up for on my site)

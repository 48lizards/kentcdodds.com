Whenever there are two things to do the same thing, people inevitably ask: "When
do I use one over the other?"

For example
["When do I use `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect`?"](/blog/useeffect-vs-uselayouteffect)
Or
["When do I use Unit, Integration, or E2E tests?"](/blog/unit-vs-integration-vs-e2e-tests)
Or
["When to use Control Props or State Reducers?"](/blog/control-props-vs-state-reducers)

I think `useState` and `useReducer` are no exception to this at all.
